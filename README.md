# Swarm Theory: Unified Field Equation Series

This repository collects the *Swarm Theory* papers — a unified series exploring how space, matter, and the constants of physics emerge from lattice coherence.

## Key Topics
- Unified Field Equation (UFE)  
- Swarm Theory and coherence geometry  
- Derivations of Planck’s constant, Sommerfeld’s constant, elementary charge  
- Vacuum permittivity (ε₀), vacuum permeability (μ₀), and vacuum wave impedance (Z₀)  
- Lattice-based unification of electromagnetism and gravity  
- UFEB (Unified Field Equation, Budget form) — update-based formulation without time  
- Philosophical implications: conservation, time, and ontological minimalism  

## Overview
Swarm Theory proposes that physical reality arises from a structured lattice of coherence membranes. From this geometry follow:
- **Physical constants** (h, α, e, ε₀, μ₀, Z₀)
- **Forces and fields** (electromagnetism, gravity, inertia)
- **Unification** through a single field equation (UFE)

## Papers
Each paper is archived on Zenodo with a DOI. Together they form one continuous series:

## FAQ
### What is the lattice made of?
The lattice is that which has the properties defined by the Unified Field Equation (UFE). At its most basic, it is real space — two-dimensional, wave-bearing, and under tension. Whether it is “made of” something is beyond our acuity, but one may think of it as stored energy: a coherence structure stretched between zero nodes. It is not substance in the old aether sense, but a field of capacity that carries and shapes waves.
A physical metaphor is the foam head on a Guinness Stout. The thin membranes of the bubbles represent the lattice, while the CO₂/N₂ inside each bubble represents the zero nodes. Yet unlike the beer foam, the lattice is not a material: it has no thickness, no mass. And the interior — the zero node — is the absence of reality itself.

### What is a Crumpler Transform (CT) ?
The **Crumpler Transform** is a reformulation of field equations in the Unified Field Equation (Budget form, UFEB) that eliminates explicit dependence on time.  
Instead of continuous time variables, physics is expressed in discrete update intervals (tau), with conservation enforced through budget identities.
- **Motivation**: Created *“by a lazy engineer for lazy physicists”*, the CT reduces algebraic overhead by collapsing differential equations into budget relations.  
- **Analogy**: As the Laplace Transform simplified differential equations into algebraic forms, the Crumpler Transform simplifies field equations into balance identities.  
- **Impact**: Complex relativistic, quantum, and gravitational effects can be calculated with simpler step functions, while still producing results with CODATA precision.

## Series Note
Each paper can be read independently, but together they trace one arc: constants, forces, and unification all as geometric consequences of lattice coherence.

## Author’s Note
*What’s the rush? Life is a Heaviside function: at some unknown point in time it discontinuously drops to zero. I am already in that latter portion of the curve. Before that step, these papers arrive in quick succession. If a paper appears after that point, then I was wrong about more than a few things.*
