# Swarm Theory: Unified Field Equation Series

This repository collects the *Swarm Theory* papers — a unified series exploring how space, matter, and the constants of physics emerge from lattice coherence.

## Overview
Swarm Theory proposes that physical reality arises from a structured lattice of coherence membranes. From this geometry follow:
- **Physical constants** (h, α, e, ε₀, μ₀, Z₀)
- **Forces and fields** (electromagnetism, gravity, inertia)
- **Unification** through a single field equation (UFE)

## Papers
Each paper is archived on Zenodo with a DOI. Together they form one continuous series:

- [Plain Language Paper](DOI link)  
- [Position Hypothesis](DOI link)  
- [Planck’s Constant (h)](DOI link)  
- [Fine-Structure Constant (α)](DOI link)  
- [Elementary Charge (e)](DOI link)  
- [Vacuum Permittivity (ε₀)](DOI link)  
- [Vacuum Permeability (μ₀)](DOI link)  
- [Vacuum Wave Impedance (Z₀)](DOI link)  
- [Unified Field Equation (UFE)](DOI link)  

*(replace DOI link with actual Zenodo DOIs)*

## Series Note
Each paper can be read independently, but together they trace one arc: constants, forces, and unification all as geometric consequences of lattice coherence.

## Author’s Note
*What’s the rush? Life is a Heaviside function: at some unknown point in time it discontinuously drops to zero. I am already in that latter portion of the curve. Before that step, these papers arrive in quick succession. If a paper appears after that point, then I was wrong about more than a few things.*
