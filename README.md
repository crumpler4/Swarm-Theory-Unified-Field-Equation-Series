# Swarm Theory: Unified Field Equation Series.  Unified Field Theory

Swarm Theory is a unified field theory approach that models the universe as a lattice of coherence. In this framework, space, matter, and the constants of physics are not fundamental but emerge from the collective behavior of this lattice. The theory introduces the concept of lattice coherence to explain quantization, wave propagation, and gravitational effects as geometric consequences of the structure. Through a series of open-access papers, the Unified Field Equation Series derives physical constants directly from first principles of geometry and coherence, offering a new perspective on unification in physics.

## Key Topics
- **Unified Field Equation (UFE)**  
  A lattice-based framework for unifying quantum mechanics, relativity, and electromagnetism.  
- **Swarm Theory and Coherence Geometry**  
  Real space modeled as a 2D coherence lattice with tension and wave-bearing capacity.  
- **Fundamental Constant Derivations**  
  Direct derivations of Planck’s constant (h), Sommerfeld’s constant (α), and the elementary charge (e).  
- **Electromagnetic Constants**  
  Vacuum permittivity (epsilon0), vacuum permeability (mu0), and vacuum wave impedance (Z0) derived from lattice geometry.  
- **Lattice-Based Unification of Electromagnetism and Gravity**  
  A coherent geometric substrate explaining both forces as emergent from the same structure.  
- **Gravitational Constant (G)**  
  Derived directly from lattice update geometry, closing the gravitational scale.  
- **UFEB (Unified Field Equation, Budget form)**  
  A simplified update-based formulation that eliminates explicit time, replacing it with discrete step functions.  
- **Philosophical Implications**  
  Conservation principles, the non-fundamentality of time, and an ontological minimalism underlying physical law.  

## Overview
Swarm Theory proposes that physical reality arises from a structured lattice of coherence membranes. From this geometry follow:
- **Physical constants** (h, α, e, ε₀, μ₀, Z₀)
- **Forces and fields** (electromagnetism, gravity, inertia)
- **Unification** through a single field equation (UFE)
- **Simplification** through removal of time in the UFEB (budget form), math is simplified while producing CODATA results.

## FAQ
### About the Author
John Paul Crumpler PE is a retired professional engineer and independent researcher focused on theoretical physics, with a particular interest in the unification of fundamental forces through geometric models of space. His work, published on CERN’s Zenodo archive, develops Swarm Theory — a framework for deriving physical constants and unified field equations from lattice coherence geometry. His research emphasizes open-access dissemination, mathematical rigor, and engagement with skeptic and scientific communities.  

### What is the lattice made of?
The lattice is that which has the properties defined by the Unified Field Equation (UFE). At its most basic, it is real space — two-dimensional, wave-bearing, and under tension. Whether it is “made of” something is beyond our acuity, but one may think of it as stored energy: a coherence structure stretched between zero nodes. It is not substance in the old aether sense, but a field of capacity that carries and shapes waves.
A physical metaphor is the foam head on a Guinness Stout. The thin membranes of the bubbles represent the lattice, while the CO₂/N₂ inside each bubble represents the zero nodes. Yet unlike the beer foam, the lattice is not a material: it has no thickness, no mass. And the interior — the zero node — is the absence of reality itself.

### What is a Crumpler Transform (CT) ?
The **Crumpler Transform** is a reformulation of field equations in the Unified Field Equation (Budget form, UFEB) that eliminates explicit dependence on time.  
Instead of continuous time variables, physics is expressed in discrete update intervals (tau), with conservation enforced through budget identities.
- **Motivation**: Created *“by a lazy engineer for lazy physicists”*, the CT reduces algebraic overhead by collapsing differential equations into budget relations.  
- **Analogy**: As the Laplace Transform simplified differential equations into algebraic forms, the Crumpler Transform simplifies field equations into balance identities.  
- **Impact**: Complex relativistic, quantum, and gravitational effects can be calculated with simpler step functions, while still producing results with CODATA precision.

## Series Note
Each paper can be read independently, but together they trace one arc: constants, forces, and unification all as geometric consequences of lattice coherence.

## Author’s Note
*What’s the rush? Life is a Heaviside function: at some unknown point in time it discontinuously drops to zero. I am already in that latter portion of the curve. Before that step, these papers arrive in quick succession. If a paper appears after that point, then I was wrong about more than a few things.*
