# Swarm Theory: Unified Field Equation Series (UFE & UFEB)

**Swarm Theory** models reality as a coherence lattice: a 2D, wave-bearing, tensioned membrane network enclosing zero-nodes. From this geometry, familiar physics **emerges**—fields, forces, and the numerical constants—without assuming them a priori.  
The series derives constants and scales directly from **coherence geometry**, and packages dynamics in an **update-budget form (UFEB)** that eliminates explicit time while preserving Relativity, Quantum behavior, and Gravity.

> *We measure progress in steps, not seconds.*

---

## Why this matters (at a glance)

- **Geometric unification:** Electromagnetism and gravity arise from the same lattice substrate.  
- **Closed constants:** Reproduces \(h,\ \alpha,\ e,\ \epsilon_0,\ \mu_0,\ Z_0,\ G\) and Planck/thermal scales from a single parameter set.  
- **Simpler math:** UFEB replaces time-based PDEs with discrete **update budgets** (Crumpler Transform).  
- **Predictive handles:** Interferometer phase step \(\Delta\phi=E\,\tau/\hbar\); redshift as \(\Delta\tau/\tau=\Delta\Phi/c^2\); tiny lattice dispersion bounds.  
- **Reproducible:** Papers (DOIs) + worked numerics + minimal scripts.

---

## Core ideas & terms

- **Unified Field Equation (UFE):** Lattice-based field equation unifying QM, Relativity, and EM.  
- **UFEB (Budget form):** Discrete update formulation; no explicit time variable.  
- **Coherence geometry:** Real space as a 2D coherence membrane under surface tension \(\Delta I\).  
- **Arthur’s Constant (\(\kappa \approx 0.92203\))** and **Scaling Factor (~544):** calibrated geometric ratios used consistently across closures.

---

## What has been derived

- **Fundamental constants:** Planck’s constant \(h\); fine-structure \(\alpha\); elementary charge \(e\).  
- **Electromagnetic scale:** \(\epsilon_0,\ \mu_0,\ Z_0\) from lattice geometry (not definitions).  
- **Gravity:** Gravitational constant \(G\) from the same update interval \(\tau\) that closes EM.  
- **Planck family:** Mass, energy, length, time from UFEB’s \(\tau\).  
- **Thermal set:** Boltzmann \(k_B\), Stefan–Boltzmann \(\sigma\), radiation constant \(a\), Wien \(b\), Planck temperature \(T_P\).  
- **Atomic touchstones:** Bohr radius \(a_0\), Rydberg \(R_\infty\), (with mass inputs noted where used).

> All results include **worked calculations** and match CODATA/SI where applicable.

## FAQ

### About the Author
**John Paul Crumpler, PE** is a professional engineer and independent researcher focused on theoretical physics, with a particular interest in unifying fundamental forces through geometric models of space. His work, published on CERN’s Zenodo archive, develops **Swarm Theory**—a framework for deriving physical constants and unified field equations from **lattice coherence geometry**. The research emphasizes open access, mathematical rigor, and constructive engagement with both skeptical and scientific communities.

---

### Is the lattice just another word for “aether”?
**No.** The lattice in Swarm Theory is not an invisible substance that carries waves. It is the **structured geometry of space itself**—a more explicit, quantitative counterpart to what relativity treats as spacetime geometry. Waves do not travel “through nothing”; they **propagate as coherence patterns in the lattice**. This avoids the paradox of “carrier waves in a vacuum” and makes quantization a direct consequence of lattice geometry.

---

### What is the lattice made of?
The lattice is **that which has the properties defined by the Unified Field Equation (UFE)**. At its most basic, it is **real space**—two-dimensional, wave-bearing, and under tension. Whether it is “made of” something is beyond our acuity; a useful intuition is **stored energy** arranged as a coherence structure stretched between zero-nodes. It is **not** a substance in the old aether sense, but a **field of capacity** that carries and shapes waves.

---

**Physical metaphor:** the foam head on a Guinness stout. The thin membranes of the bubbles represent the lattice; the CO₂/N₂ inside each bubble represents the zero-nodes. Unlike beer foam, the lattice **is not a material**: it has **no thickness** and **no mass**. The interior (the zero-node) is the **absence of physical reality**.

---

### What is a “swarm”?
In **Swarm Theory**, a swarm is **not** a biological colony or an algorithm. It is a **coherence structure in the lattice of space**. A swarm forms when waves of lattice tension intersect, reinforce, and create a **stable configuration** (standing-wave pattern). Depending on geometry, swarms can behave like **particles, fields, or persistent waveforms**. For example, **electrons and protons** are long-lived swarms that persist indefinitely.

An analogy is a **hurricane** on the ocean: a persistent, self-organized energy pattern. In short, a **swarm** is the **fundamental unit of persistence** in the lattice—the building block from which space, matter, and physical law emerge.

**Key points**
- A **swarm** is a **pattern of coherence**, not a physical substance.  
- It **emerges** from collective behavior of lattice membranes around zero-nodes.  
- **Stable swarms** correspond to the long-lived particles and constants we observe.  
- **Temporary swarms** correspond to excitations, interactions, and decay.

**Which particles are non-persistent swarms?**  
**Non-persistent swarms** are short-lived coherence patterns that cannot sustain themselves in the lattice. They arise when lattice tension waves intersect in unstable geometries, producing transient excitations that relax into more stable forms. In contrast, **electrons, protons, positrons, and antiprotons** are **persistent** swarms.

**Examples of non-persistent swarms include:**
- **Unstable leptons:** muon (μ⁻), tau (τ⁻)  
- **Hadrons:** free neutrons (outside nuclei), mesons (pions, kaons), baryon resonances (Δ, Λ, Σ, …)  
- **Bosons:** W⁺/W⁻, Z⁰, Higgs; **gluons** (confined, not persistent in free form)  
- **Other transient states:** unstable nuclei (radioisotopes), quark–antiquark bound states (e.g., charmonium, bottomonium), high-energy resonances in collisions

### What is a Crumpler Transform (CT)?
The **Crumpler Transform** is a reformulation of field equations in the **Unified Field Equation, Budget form (UFEB)** that **eliminates explicit time**.  
Instead of continuous time \(t\), physics is expressed in **discrete update intervals** \(\tau\), with conservation enforced through **budget identities**.

- **Motivation:** Created *“by a lazy engineer for lazy physicists”*, CT collapses differential equations into **budget relations** to reduce algebraic overhead.  
- **Analogy:** As the **Laplace Transform** turns differential equations into algebraic ones, the **Crumpler Transform** turns field dynamics into **balance identities** per update.  
- **Impact:** Complex relativistic, quantum, and gravitational effects can be computed with **simple step functions**, while still reproducing **CODATA-level results**.

## Series Note
Each paper can be read independently, but together they trace a single arc: **constants, forces, and unification** all as **geometric consequences of lattice coherence**.

---

## Author’s Note
**What’s the rush?** Life is a Heaviside function: at some unknown point in time it discontinuously drops to zero. I am already in that latter portion of the curve. Before that step, these papers arrive in quick succession. If a paper appears after that point, then I was wrong about more than a few things.*
